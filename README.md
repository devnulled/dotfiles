dotfiles
========

My dotfiles.  Pretty much for my own use, but feel free to borrow/use.

Not really happy with them at the moment.. the git stuff is pretty decent, but I need to refactor most of everything else and add a lot more helper aliases.

I used to manage these with a crappy rsync script, but now I use [Homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick).

To get started with my dotfiles after installing Homesick, run the following commands:

	homesick clone git://github.com/devnulled/dotfiles.git

	homesick symlink dotfiles
